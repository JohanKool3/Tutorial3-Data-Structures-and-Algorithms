# Sorting Algorithms


- Sorted is better, because it allows you to discount items that are smaller than the selected value

## Selection Sort
	- Find smallest item, iterate through all elements
	- Take index of smallest item and swap it to first entry
	- Update the pointer of the sorted portion of the list (index = 0)


## Bubble Sort
	- Compare neighbouring values. If the right is greater than the left, swap
	- Only complete when no swaps have been made by the algorithm

## Insertion Sort
	- Iterate through items one at a time.
	- If the item is bigger
